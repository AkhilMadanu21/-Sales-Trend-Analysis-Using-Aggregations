‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This Project
1. Create a database
```sql

CREATE DATABASE online_sales;
USE online_sales;
```

2. Create the sales table
```sql

CREATE TABLE sales (
    order_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    product_id VARCHAR(10)
);
```

3. Import the dataset
Open MySQL Workbench or CLI

Use the LOAD DATA command (adjust file path to your system):

```sql

LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/online_sales.csv'
INTO TABLE sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(order_id, order_date, amount, product_id);
```

4. Run the queries
Copy-paste any of the above queries into your MySQL environment to view results.
